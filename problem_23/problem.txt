Manager of ACM-ICPC Thailand Contest Council is planning to buy lands in Phuket to build the office
building for national programming skill camp and programming contest that will be held on Phuket
regularly in the future. The land price in Phuket is becoming more expensive in every year. The price
increases in the exponential growth curves by a factor of year. If the land i whose initial cost is Li
bought in t years from now, its price will be 2x(Li)
t
. All land prices are different. ACM-ICPC can
buy only one land per year. You have to help the manager to buy the lands at lowest price within the
budget of 5,000,000 millions baht.
For example, if we want to buy 3 lands with costs 7, 2 and 10 in 3 consecutive years, the total price
will be calculated as follow.
(2 × 7) + (2 × 2^2) + (2 × 10^3) = 2022 millions baht

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10), the number of test cases. Each test case
contains integer Li which is the cost of land in million baht. There are less than 40 lands in each test
case. The line contains ‘0’ (zero) indicates the end of each test case.


Output
For each test case, print out the minimum price for purchasing all lands. If the total price exceeds the
budget (5,000,000 millions baht), print out ‘Too expensive’.
