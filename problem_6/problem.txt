Given a string of 0’s and 1’s up to 1000000 characters long and indices i and j, you are to answer
a question whether all characters between position min(i, j) and position max(i, j) (inclusive) are the
same.

Input
There are multiple cases on input. The first line of each case gives a string of 0’s and 1’s. The next
line contains a positive integer n giving the number of queries for this case. The next n lines contain
queries, one per line. Each query is given by two non-negative integers, i and j. For each query, you
are to print ‘Yes’ if all characters in the string between position min(i, j) and position max(i, j) are the
same, and ‘No’ otherwise.


Output
Each case on output should start with a heading as in the sample below. The input ends with an empty
string that is a line containing only the new line character, this string should not be processed. The
input may also with end of file. So keep check for both.
